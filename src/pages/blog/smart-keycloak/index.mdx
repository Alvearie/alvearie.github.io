### Introduction
The [IBM FHIR Server](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR) implements [HL7 FHIR version 4.0.1 (R4)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4) and supports the 
FHIR REST API for each resource type defined in the specification.

However, one thing that neither the HL7 FHIR specification nor the IBM FHIR Server prescribe is the security model for this interface.
Enter SMART on FHIR.

[SMART on FHIR](https://docs.smarthealthit.org) is a collection of specifications that focus on authentication and authorization on top of HL7 FHIR.
In November of 2018, the Boston Children's Hospital and HL7 published the first of these specifications called the 
[SMART App Launch Framework](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/). This specification extends OAuth 2.0 with `scopes` and `launch context`.

SMART *scopes* are normal OAuth 2.0 scope strings that are used to define an authorization model that is aligned with FHIR resources.
The specification scopes via a pattern like `<context>/<resourceType>.<permission>`, where
- *context* is `patient` or `user`;
- *resourceType* is one of the resource types defined in the HL7 FHIR specification, or `*` to indicate all resource types; and
- *permission* is `read` or `write`, or `*` for read and write.

SMART *launch context* is what allows a user to launch an application in the context of a given user session or patient record.
SMART App Launch defines two different launch varieties: one for launching apps from an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system and one for launching "standalone" apps.

In this post, I walk through how to support standalone app launch with the IBM FHIR Server via [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org), 
an open source identity and access management solution.
