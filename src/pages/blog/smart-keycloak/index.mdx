### Background
The [IBM FHIR Server](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR) implements [HL7 FHIR version 4.0.1 (R4)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4) and supports the 
FHIR REST API for each resource type defined in the specification.

However, one thing that neither the HL7 FHIR specification nor the IBM FHIR Server prescribe is the security model for this interface.
Enter SMART on FHIR.

[SMART on FHIR](https://docs.smarthealthit.org) is a collection of specifications that focus on authentication and authorization on top of HL7 FHIR.
In November of 2018, Boston Children's Hospital and HL7 published the first of these specifications called the [SMART App Launch Framework](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/).
This specification extends OAuth 2.0 with custom `scopes` and the notion of `launch context`.

SMART *scopes* are normal OAuth 2.0 scope strings that are used to define an authorization model that is aligned with FHIR resources.
The specification defines the scope strings via a pattern like `<context>/<resourceType>.<permission>`, where
- *context* is `patient` or `user`;
- *resourceType* is one of the resource types defined in the HL7 FHIR specification, or `*` to indicate all resource types; and
- *permission* is `read` or `write`, or `*` for read and write.

SMART *launch context* is what allows a user to launch an application in the context of a given user session or patient record.
SMART App Launch defines two different launch varieties: one for launching apps from an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system and one for launching "standalone" apps.

In this post, I walk through how to support standalone app launch with the IBM FHIR Server via [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org), 
an open source identity and access management solution.

### Introducing the Alvearie Keycloak Extensions for FHIR
Keycloak is wonderfully-extensible and easily-configurable.
Users can automate the creation of SMART *scopes* through scipting or configuration, or manually create them via the admin console.
However, supporting SMART *launch context* is a bit more tricky.

In particular, SMART extends the OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect token *response payload* with a set of [launch context parameters](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context/index.html#launch-context-arrives-with-your-access_token). For example, in the case of the `patient` context, a SMART-enabled client application would expect a `patient` parameter in the token response payload (alongside the access token).

In addition to the above, SMART App Launch also defines a custom `aud` parameter that clients must pass on their [authorization](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/#step-1-app-asks-for-authorization) request (in addition to the fields required by OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect). Per the SMART "best practices" document at http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization/best-practices/#25-access-token-phishing-by-counterfeit-resource-servers, authorization servers should validate this field and use this same value for the `aud` claim in the granted access token.

Neither of these OAuth extensions are supported by Keycloak out-of-the-box (nor almost any other commercial Authorization server) and, for these reasons, the IBM team behind the IBM FHIR Server have introduced a set of [Keycloak extensions](https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir) that fill these gaps.

### Using the Alvearie Keycloak Extensions for FHIR
The Keycloak extensions for FHIR project currently consists of two components:
- *keycloak-config* for automating the configuration of a Keycloak realm in support of standalone app launch with patient context
- *keycloak-extensions* which defines a set of extensions that fill the gaps in Keycloak's support of SMART App Launch:
  - an AudienceValidator authenticator for validating that the `aud` parameter passed to the server matches the desired value
  - a UserAttributeMapper mapper for mapping user attributes into custom fields in the token response payload (rather than claims in the issued tokens)

To use the extensions:
1. Build the keycloak-extensions project into a jar file and add it to the [`standalone/deployments`](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#packaging-classes-and-deployment-2) directory of your Keycloak installation.
    - Note: moving forward, we hope to add continuous integration support and publish the built artifacts to Maven Central.
3. Configure a realm in your Keycloak installation for SMART App Launch, either manually or via the `keycloak-config` project.
    - In addition to defining all the SMART scopes, the `keycloak-config` automation will create a default group called `fhirUser` (so that all new users will belong to it), and a Group Membership mapper for adding this group to the access token. This group detail is used to map users to a security-role in the IBM FHIR Server (described below).

    - The `keycloak-config` automation does **not** yet add a mapper for adding the patient parameter to the token response. To support that, add the `User Attribute (with token response support)` Mapper to the `launch/patient` scope and configure it to map a user attribute (e.g. `resourceId`) to the token response.

3. Manually define a new *Authentication Flow* that requires Audience Validation before login.

4. Add your users and ensure they have a user attribute value that matches the one you mapped in step two.
