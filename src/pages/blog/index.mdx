Once any information is digitized and secured using methods such as encryption, firewalls and authorization mechanisms, the next 
logical step is to mine the data to gain insight. However, before any personal data can be used to support secondary purposes, 
applicable privacy laws that govern this personal data, such as HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA, or others, must be understood and 
adhered to in addition to security requirements.

<font color="#2bb2ff">SMART App Launch with Keycloak and the IBM FHIR Server</font></a>
<br/>

The IBM FHIR Server implements HL7 FHIR version 4.0.1 (R4) and supports the FHIR REST API for each resource type defined in the specification.
However, one thing that neither the HL7 FHIR specification nor the IBM FHIR Server prescribe is the security model for this interface. 
Enter SMART on FHIR.   <a href="/blog/smart-keycloak" style={{"text-decoration": "none"}}><font color="#2bb2ff">Read more</font></a>

No matter who you are or what you do, everyone has an interest in healthcare. Whether you are a provider, 
a payer, a patient, a researcher, or some other important part of the complex healthcare web, 
the way that healthcare is managed and delivered matters to you. Simply put, you care about the way healthcare 
happens.   <a href="/blog/getting-started-with-alvearie" style={{"text-decoration": "none"}}><font color="#2bb2ff">Read more</font></a>

Healthcare data is often trapped in a maze of digital applications or records systems that don't interoperate. 
As a result, healthcare technology professionals are limited in their ability to bring data, technology, and 
clinical expertise together to transform healthcare for providers, payers, governments, pharmaceutical companies, 
and other healthcare organizations. <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/components/kafka/blogs/4-reasons-to-join-project-alvearie-ibms-open-source-healthcare-effort/" style={{"text-decoration": "none"}}><font color="#2bb2ff">Read more</font></a>

<font color="#2bb2ff">Using Open Source to Build a Healthcare Record Ingestion Pattern</font></a>
<br/>
By Luis A. Garcia &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; Published February 9, 2021

The increasing digitization of healthcare records has made it more important to have a set of technologies and 
infrastructure that enable healthcare organizations to effectively create, store, transform, exchange, and consume 
these records. This post demonstrates how it is possible to build a reference implementation for processing 
healthcare records that addresses several common use cases, using only open source technologies. <a href="/blog/clinical-records-ingestion-pattern" style={{"text-decoration": "none"}}><font color="#2bb2ff">Read more</font></a>
