For example, in the case of the `patient` context, a SMART-enabled client application would expect a `patient` parameter in the token response payload (alongside the access token).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, SMART App Launch also defines a custom `aud` parameter that clients must pass on their [authorization](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/#step-1-app-asks-for-authorization) request (in addition to the fields required by OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect). Per the SMART \"best practices\" document at http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization/best-practices/#25-access-token-phishing-by-counterfeit-resource-servers, authorization servers should validate this field and use this same value for the `aud` claim in the granted access token.\r\n\r\nNeither of these OAuth extensions are supported by Keycloak out-of-the-box (nor almost any other commercial Authorization server) and, for these reasons, the IBM team behind the IBM FHIR Server have introduced a set of [Keycloak extensions](https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir) that fill these gaps.\r\n\r\n### Using the Alvearie Keycloak Extensions for FHIR\r\nThe Keycloak extensions for FHIR project currently consists of two components:\r\n- *keycloak-config* for automating the configuration of a Keycloak realm in support of standalone app launch with patient context\r\n- *keycloak-extensions* which defines a set of extensions that fill the gaps in Keycloak's support of SMART App Launch:\r\n  - an AudienceValidator authenticator for validating that the `aud` parameter passed to the server matches the desired value\r\n  - a UserAttributeMapper mapper for mapping user attributes into custom fields in the token response payload (rather than claims in the issued tokens)\r\n\r\nTo use the extensions:\r\n1. Build the keycloak-extensions project into a jar file and add it to the [`standalone/deployments`](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#packaging-classes-and-deployment-2) directory of your Keycloak installation.\r\n    - Note: moving forward, we hope to publish the built artifacts to Maven Central.\r\n3. Configure a realm in your Keycloak installation for SMART App Launch, either manually or via the `keycloak-config` project.\r\n    - In addition to defining all the SMART scopes, the `keycloak-config` automation will create a default group called `fhirUser` (so that all new users will belong to it), and a Group Membership mapper for adding this group to the access token. This group detail is used to map users to a security-role in the IBM FHIR Server (described below).\r\n    ![Group-Membership-mapper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5478798/111356103-68e7c680-865e-11eb-8d0c-1c4315a78634.png)\r\n    - The `keycloak-config` automation does **not** yet add a mapper for adding the patient parameter to the token response. To support that, add the `User Attribute (with token response support)` Mapper to the `launch/patient` scope and configure it to map a user attribute (e.g. `resourceId`) to the token response.\r\n    ![patient-id-mapper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5478798/111354064-4c4a8f00-865c-11eb-9913-e5931e883175.png)\r\n3. Manually define a new *Authentication Flow* that requires Audience Validation before login.\r\n    ![SMART-Authentication-flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5478798/111352797-f75a4900-865a-11eb-9850-302cd3c47973.png)\r\n4. Add your users and ensure they have a user attribute value that matches the one you mapped in step two.\r\n    ![User-attribute](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5478798/111354473-bb27e800-865c-11eb-8432-94e0a647beaa.png)\r\n\r\n### Configuring the IBM FHIR Server\r\nNow that you have Keycloak configured, its time to hook up the IBM FHIR Server.\r\nThe IBM FHIR Server supports [OpenLiberty configDropins](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/server-configuration-overview.html#server-xml) for configuring server behavior. To configure the server to validate Keycloak-issued tokens, modify `configDropins/disabled/jwtRP.xml` for you Keycloak installation and move it to `configDropins/overrides/`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<server>\r\n    <!-- Enable features -->\r\n    <featureManager>\r\n        <!-- mpJwt-1.1 is already enabled in the default server.xml, but it doesn't hurt to repeat it here -->\r\n        <feature>mpJwt-1.1</feature>\r\n    </featureManager>\r\n\r\n    <!-- Override the application-bnd binding of the main webapp -->\r\n    <webApplication

</security-role>\r\n        </application-bnd>\r\n    </webApplication>\r\n\r\n    <!-- This MP JWT configuration validates JWT access tokens and injects them into\r\n         ResourceScoped beans for inspection. -->\r\n    <mpJwt id=\"jwtConsumer\"\r\n           clockSkew=\"1m\"\r\n           jwksUri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/${env.KEYCLOAK_REALM}/protocol/openid-connect/certs\"\r\n

 <requestUrl urlPattern=\"/fhir-server\" />\r\n    </authFilter>\r\n</server>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to enforce the SMART scopes passed, the server must be configured with the [fhir-smart](https://bintray.com/ibm-watson-health/ibm-fhir-server-releases/fhir-smart) persistence interceptor (by dropping the jar file into the `userlib` directory of your IBM FHIR Server installation).\r\n\r\nFinaly, to advertise the SMART support and make the auth endpoints discoverable, update the `security` section of the `fhir-server-config.json` as described in the [IBM FHIR Server User's Guide](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide#533-advertise-the-oauth-endpoints-via-fhir-server-config):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n...\r\n    \"security\": {\r\n      \"cors\":

Launch, how to support those extensions via the Alvearie Keycloak Extensions for FHIR, and how to use this project together with the IBM FHIR Server to support SMART App Launch.\r\n\r\nSMART App Launch is just one of the specifications defined by SMART-on-FHIR and the authentication and authorization challenges in healthcare are immense. We'd love to hear from members of the FHIR community, the SMART-on-FHIR community, and the Keycloak community on the approach outlined here and where you'd like to see us go next.

Launch, how to support those extensions via the Alvearie Keycloak Extensions for FHIR, and how to use this project together with the IBM FHIR Server to support SMART App Launch.\r\n\r\nSMART App Launch is just one of the specifications defined by SMART-on-FHIR and the authentication and authorization challenges in healthcare are immense. We'd love to hear from members of the FHIR community, the SMART-on-FHIR community, and the Keycloak community on the approach outlined here and where you'd like to see us go next. Please connect with us on [chat.fhir.org](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179170-smart/topic/Keycloak.20for.20SMART.20authz), the [Keycloak Extensions for FHIR project](https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir), or the [IBM FHIR Server project](https://github.com/ibm/fhir) about how we can take this to the next level.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSMART is a trademark of The Children’s Medical Center Corporation.\r\nFHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7.
