Medical imaging study data, however, is stored in an alternate infomatics \r\nsystem than HL7/FHIR clinical data. Commonly, a _Picture Archiving and Communication System_ (PACS) would efficiently store the \r\nmedical imaging data and provide access to that data using _Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine_ (DICOM) standards. \r\nThe [Alvearie Imaging Ingestion](https://github.com/Alvearie/health-patterns/tree/main/clinical-ingestion) \r\ncomponent provides a number of subcomponents for ingesting, managing, and routing medical imaging \r\nstudies. This post explores how to use a subset of those subcomponents to augment the _Clinical Data Ingestion and \r\nEnrichment_ health patterns with medical imaging study information.\r\n\r\n### What is DICOM\r\n\r\nDICOM is an extensive specification for both the medical imaging data and the communication of said data. For the \r\npurposes of this post, we can take a narrow view of the DICOM information model as essentially a four-tiered \r\nhierarchical structure. At the root is the _patient_. A patient has a number of imaging _studies_, each study \r\nconsists of a number of modality specific series, and a series is comprised of an ordered list of _Service-Object \r\nPair Instances_ (SOP Instances). A SOP Instance may be a single image, a number of image frames, a structured report, \r\nan audio recording, etc.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot](dicom_relationships.png)\r\n\r\nA DICOM study is unbounded. As an unbounded entity, each SOP Instance is an independently managed observation \r\ncontaining all of the reference information to establish its location within the hierarchical DICOM model. \r\nThis is generally referred to as a _Composite Object Instance_. As a consumer of DICOM, we never know when new SOP \r\nInstances will be created or sent. For example, as a patient participates in a medical imaging study they move \r\nbetween modalities. A modality establishes the patient orientation in 3D space, and captures a number of SOP \r\nInstances (i.e. images) as an ordered series within the established orientation. Each modality sends the collected \r\nSOP Instance to the PACS at different points in time. As the SOP Instances arrive at the PACS, they are organized \r\ninto the DICOM information model.\r\n\r\n### Capturing DICOM with FHIR resources\r\n\r\nFHIR captures a patient's medical imaging studies with _ImagingStudy_ resources. The _ImagingStudy_ resource provides a \r\nmetadata model that mirrors a subset of the previously described DICOM hierarchical (study, series, SOP instance) \r\ninformation model. As metadata, it does not include the raw SOP Instance content. The _ImagingStudy_ resource uses the \r\n_Reference_ resource to indicate where the SOP Instances are stored within the DICOM infomatics systems. Therefore, \r\nhaving a FHIR repository is not sufficient for managing all of the information in the study. We need a separate repository \r\nfor storage, and services for retrieval, of SOP Instances that are referenced from the _ImagingStudy_. A user-agent interacting \r\nwith patient FHIR _ImagingStudy_ resources is provided the hierarchical metadata of the study but must work with referenced \r\nservices to retrieve the SOP Instances from the repository.\r\n\r\n### Alvearie Imaging Ingestion Approach\r\n\r\nAlvearie Imaging Ingestion is a real-time, event-driven subsystem for ingesting, managing, and routing DICOM SOP Instances. \r\nBeyond that, it also provides the ability to conveniently interact with DICOM at the study level as opposed to the instance; \r\nas is the case with the FHIR _ImagingStudy_. The Alvearie Imaging Ingestion component achieves this by providing a number of \r\nsubcomponents, each as an independent Kubernetes Custom Resource for deployment and management. This subcomponent approach \r\nallows for custom deployments of incremental medical imaging capabilities to enable a number of different use cases. The \r\nsubcomponents are designed to work together, providing DICOM standards-based request-response services on the edges with the \r\nindividual components interacting in an event-driven pattern within the core. It is simple to create highly elastic topologies \r\nof resilient subcomponents that incrementally scale up and down with demand. Many more details are provided within the \r\n[Alvearie Imaging Ingestion](https://github.com/Alvearie/imaging-ingestion/) GitHub pages.\r\n\r\n### Simplified Ingestion Topology\r\n\r\nIn order to add DICOM data to the _Clinical Data Ingestion and Enrichment_ health patterns, we essentially have four requirements:\r\n\r\n1.\tWe need a standards-based DICOM service for ingesting the SOP Instance data.\r\n2.\tWe need a runtime to manage the SOP Instances and form an opinion of when a study is complete. This runtime should create a revisioned history of studies as they change over time.\r\n3.\tFor each revision of an imaging study, we need to generate and publish FHIR _ImagingStudy_ resource to the clinical enrichment pipeline.\r\n4.\tWe need a service for retrieving the previously ingested SOP Instances from references in the generated FHIR _ImagingStudy_.\r\n\r\nA simplified, but limited, approach could be to provide the following topology and resulting data flow:\r\n\r\n![Imaging ingestion flow](imaging-ingestion-flow.png)\r\n\r\nDICOM SOP Instances are ingested into the system through the _DICOMweb_ STOW-RS REST service (1) provided by the **DICOMweb Ingestion \r\nService**. As SOP Instances are successfully stored into an S3 bucket (2), Cloud Events (3) are generated for the next subcomponent \r\nin the pipeline; the DICOM Event Driven Ingestion. The **DICOM Event Driven Ingestion** captures a manifest of all the SOP Instances \r\ningested within the pipeline, forming a hierarchical DICOM study model (4) as well as an opinion of whether a complete study has \r\nbeen ingested. Once the DICOM Event Driven Ingestion determines a study has likely been completely ingested, it generates a Cloud \r\nEvent (5) for that first revision of the imaging study. The **DICOM Study Binding** subscribes to the study-based Cloud Events and \r\ngenerates a FHIR _ImagingStudy_ resource for the imaging study and publishes to (6) the FHIR Ingestion service. A user-agent can \r\nretrieve the _ImagingStudy_ resource (7), containing the DICOM hierarchy of the imaging study. Each SOP Instance within the \r\n_ImagingStudy_ is represented as an endpoint reference to the DICOMweb Ingestion service where it was originally ingested. \r\nThe SOP Instances can subsequently be retrieved using the DICOMweb WADO-RS (8) provided with that DICOMweb Ingestion Service.\r\n\r\n### Extended Ingestion Topology\r\n\r\nIn the real world, medical imaging centers are less likely to use DICOMweb and much more likely to use DICOM Message Service \r\nElement (DIMSE) services for communication of DICOM data. Specifically, images are stored using a DIMSE C-Store composite \r\noperation as opposed to the DICOMweb STOW-RS in the simplified topology. As such, we need to extend the previously defined \r\nSimplified Approach to enable a bridge from DIMSE to the ingestion services.\r\n\r\n![Imaging extended topology](imaging-extended-topology.png)\r\n\r\nThe resulting topology is identical to the Simplified Approach with the exception that we introduced the **DIMSE Ingestion Service** \r\nfor processing DIMSE C-STORE operations (1b). Also, we have added a **DIMSE Proxy** that acts as a DIMSE Application Entity (AE) to \r\ndirectly integrate with the existing DIMSE based communication systems within the medical imaging center. The DIMSE proxy and \r\nDIMSE Ingestion subcomponents use a [NATS](https://nats.io/) messaging service to bridge the DICOM to a multi-zone regional cloud deployment.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe _Imaging Ingestion_ component provides several different subcomponents for ingesting, managing, and routing DICOM SOP Instances \r\nas well as the associated medical imaging studies. These specialized subcomponents can be composed into custom, fit for purpose, \r\nuse-case driven topologies. In this post, we have explored how using a subset of the provided components can be used to extend \r\nthe _Clinical Ingestion and Enrichment_ health patterns to include DICOM medical imaging data. Detailed documentation and deployment \r\ndetails of each of the subcomponents is readily available within the [Alvearie Imaging Ingestion](https://github.com/Alvearie/imaging-ingestion) GitHub pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p/>","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"fe39d7923533ed9e5b9186aa6697afbf","counter":158,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Adding DICOM Imaging Studies to Clinical Data Ingestion","description":"Adding DICOM Imaging Studies to Clinical Data Ingestion"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: Adding DICOM Imaging Studies to Clinical Data Ingestion\r\ndescription: Adding DICOM Imaging Studies to Clinical Data Ingestion\r\n---\r\nBy Richard Duggan &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; Published June 17, 2021\r\n\r\nThe Alvearie _Clinical Data Ingestion and Enrichment_ health patterns capture how to both ingest and enrich HL7 and \r\nFHIR data destined for a FHIR repository.
