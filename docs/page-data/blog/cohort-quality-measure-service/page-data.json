IBM Cohort Service builds upon and extends a number of other open \r\nsource initiatives oriented around support for CQL including [CQL Engine](https://github.com/DBCG/cql_engine), \r\n[Clinical Quality Language](https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language) and [cqf ruler](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler).\r\n\r\n### IBM Cohort Service Release 1 Focus Areas\r\n\r\nRelease 1.0 of the IBM Cohort Service focuses on delivering an initial set of capabilities that span the cohort and quality measure development and \r\ndeployment lifecycle. These capabilities include:\r\n\r\n  - Ability to evaluate both CQL-defined logic and FHIR-based Measure definitions that are based on CQL against patient data that is maintained in a FHIR server.\r\n  - Utilities for deploying FHIR Measure, CQL library and value set definitions to a FHIR server that serves as a repository to manage these artifacts.\r\n  - An initial set of measure execution runtime performance optimizations focused on inter-measure performance improvement. These optimizations take advantage of caching patient data for use when evaluating a set of quality measures against a given patient.\r\n\r\nIBM Cohort Service provides a number of different interfaces to integrate IBM Cohort Service into a larger enterprise solution:\r\n  - Java APIs that can be used to embed the cohort and measure evaluation function into another application or solution\r\n  - Command line interfaces to facilitate cohort and measure test automation as well as support for integrating cohort service use into a continuous integration and deployment pipeline\r\n  - REST API to facilitate integration of cohort evaluation and test function into other web-based applications\r\n\r\n### Learn By Example\r\n\r\nA great example illustrating the use of IBM Cohort Service with IBM FHIR server can be found within the \r\n[Alvearie Health Patterns](https://github.com/Alvearie/health-patterns/tree/main/cohort-service) project. \r\nThis example shows how to use FHIR server as a repository to store and update CQL library definitions and demonstrates \r\nhow IBM Cohort Service can be used to evaluate clinical logic represented in CQL against a set of patient data stored in FHIR.\r\n\r\n### More To Come...\r\n\r\nThis is our initial foray aimed at supporting this important new standard that will drive future work on clinical decision support and \r\nquality management solutions in healthcare. Future work on IBM Cohort Service will focus on additional optimization of CQL execution, \r\nthe ability to scale execution of CQL evaluation to deal with large patient populations and the ability to deal with other types of underlying \r\ndata models that are in use for healthcare analytics.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your use and feedback on this initial release as well as your input and contributions to guide future \r\nenhancements to the IBM Cohort Service project.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee our [Getting Started](https://alvearie.io/quality-measure-and-cohort-service/#/user-guide/getting-started) guide for more information on how to get started!\r\n\r\n\r\n<p/>","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"2369b9c9b3bc27a12bb7d823c64ea729","counter":122,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing the IBM Cohort and Quality Measure Service","description":"Release 1.0 of the IBM Cohort and Quality Measure Service focuses on delivering an initial set of capabilities that span the cohort and quality measure development and deployment lifecycle."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: Introducing the IBM Cohort and Quality Measure Service\r\ndescription: Release 1.0 of the IBM Cohort and Quality Measure Service focuses on delivering an initial set of capabilities that span the cohort and quality measure development and deployment lifecycle.\r\n---\r\nBy Rick Stevens &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; Published June 3, 2021\r\n\r\nClinical Quality Language ([CQL](https://cql.hl7.org/)) is an emerging HL7 specification for capturing clinical logic and knowledge to drive a variety of important \r\nhealth care use cases including those that deal with:\r\n\r\n  - Clinical Decision Support (CDS).
