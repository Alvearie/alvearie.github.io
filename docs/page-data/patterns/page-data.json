It is still available to be deployed and run as part of ingestion, but it can also be set up on its own.\r\nIf it is run as part of _Ingestion_ it will Enrich the data as it comes into the environment, before it is stored in the FHIR Server.  It can also be run after the data is persisted in the FHIR server and configured to run on new or changed data.\r\nThe goal for this _Enrichment_ pattern is that the enriched data will be written to a FHIR server by default, but because these patterns are just reference implementations, they can be modified and consumed in a number of ways.\r\n\r\n_Enrichment_ will read FHIR data from a [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) topic and use [NiFi](https://github.com/apache/nifi) to orchestrate the optional types of enrichment such as:\r\n- Convert terminology using the FHIR Terminology Services\r\n- [De-identify](https://github.com/Alvearie/de-identification) the FHIR data\r\n- Run an algorithm such as [ASCVD](https://github.com/Alvearie/health-analytics/tree/main/ascvd)\r\n- Run NLP against the unstructured data such as [FHIR DocumentReference](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documentreference.html)\r\n\r\nThe flexibility of this approach allows the consumer to use enrichment at the appropriate time.
